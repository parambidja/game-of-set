# game-of-set
This Python program models a card game known as Set War. This game is founded based on the principles of the Game of Set, in which the deck consists of cards with four features: number (one, two, or three); symbol (diamond, squiggle, oval); shading (solid, striped, or open); and color (red, green, or purple). These attributes are modeled through the input, for which the string of cards requested is a string made of 4 digit numbers with bits ranging from 0-2 where each distinct number represents a card, and each bit of that number represents the features of that card. Apart from choosing the cards in your deck, the simulation allows you to choose the number of players playing.

To play the game, open the driver file ("PlaySetWar.py") from the command line.
